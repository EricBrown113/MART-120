	<h1>Short Story</h1>
	<br />
	
<p>I have always like art so I started drawing random things mostly flowers because <br />
of the different shades you can use also the numerous selection of flowers there is. <br />
Than I got into woodburning and tattooing which I love doing in my off time. Here is <br />
an example of one of my woodburnigs I hope you like it.</p>
